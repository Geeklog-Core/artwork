All icons drawn/edited with Inkscape ( www.inkscape.org ).
Warning: other SVG rendering engines may produce incorrect results.

If you do have Inkscape, then you may find the script "render.sh" useful for
rendering every source file in this directory in one go and with multi-cpu
support (please 'cd' to this directory before executing it, as very little
error handling has been implemented).
